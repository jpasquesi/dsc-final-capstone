## Overview
The NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball tournament is one of the most exciting sports tournaments of the year. Millions of people, myself included, tune in with the hopes of creating the "perfect bracket" and each year it always seems to be essentially impossible. Personally, it has always been fascinating how rare it is to get a perfect bracket or anything close to it. This year, Northwestern made the NCAA tournament for only the second time in school history so I was more invested this year when it came to my bracket. I joined a bracket with family and friends and tried my best to look at statistics of teams and put in a little more effort than usual only for, once again, my bracket to fail miserably right after the first round. As a data scientist, I wanted to see if there was a way to be able to better predict the winners in March Madness. Therefore, I took a look at historical college basketball data and wanted to see can we better predict the winner of games in the NCAA March Madness tournamnet.
